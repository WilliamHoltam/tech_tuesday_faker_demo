# tech_tuesday_faker_demo
This repo contains code I developed as part of a brown bag presentation.

The intention was to:
* Demonstrate how to insert data into MySQL using Python.
* Demonstrate the capabilities of the Faker Python library.
* Demonstrate how I would refactor the code to make it "client ready".

Library documentation can be found here: https://faker.readthedocs.io
